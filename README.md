# FJONG Technical interview

Thanks for your interest in joining the team here at FJONG!  This task is the the next step in your interview process.

## The Task

In the `src` directory are three problem files:
- `src/problem-1.js`
- `src/problem-2.js`
- `src/problem-3.js`

Inside each of the problem files, there is a task to complete.  A set of test cases is provided for each problem, which you can run with `npm run test`.  Your task is to create a new branch, get the test cases passing, and open a pull request for your branch for us to review.

## Guidelines

- Take it one step at a time, and commit frequently.  We want to see see your work in progress, not just a finished solution.
- Nobody's perfect.  You do not have to get 100% of the test cases working in order to submit your code for review.
- We work as a team.  You can ask us for help if you run into a problem.
- ES5 or ES6 code is fine.
